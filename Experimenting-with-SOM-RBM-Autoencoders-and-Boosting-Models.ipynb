    "Report: Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction and Classifier Performance on Breast Cancer Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment was to apply three dimensionality reduction techniques—Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), and Autoencoders—and compare their performance against the original dataset using three classifiers: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Performance was measured in terms of classification accuracy and execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Dataset achieved the highest accuracy for all classifiers, with CatBoost performing best at 98.57%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality-Reduced Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "RBM and Autoencoder consistently outperformed SOM in terms of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoder-based reduction achieved competitive accuracy, closely matching the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost and LightGBM demonstrated faster training times compared to CatBoost across all datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOM was the fastest dimensionality reduction technique due to its simplicity but slightly lagged in classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders and RBMs showed moderate training times, balancing complexity and accuracy effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "SOM: Efficient but limited in maintaining feature importance, resulting in lower accuracy compared to RBM and Autoencoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "RBM: Achieved higher accuracy with moderately faster training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoder: Delivered a balance between accuracy and training time, making it a suitable choice for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "For high accuracy and acceptable training time, the original dataset with CatBoost performed best, albeit at a higher computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among dimensionality reduction techniques, Autoencoder emerged as the most effective, providing a trade-off between accuracy and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scenarios prioritizing speed, LightGBM with SOM provided the quickest solution, although with slightly lower accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment highlights the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction methods and classifiers, emphasizing the importance of selecting techniques based on task-specific requirements such as accuracy and computational efficiency."
